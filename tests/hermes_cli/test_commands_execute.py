"""Invariant tests for registry-owned slash execution (CommandDef.execute).

Every ``CommandDef`` with ``execute`` set must:
  * name a key that exists in :data:`hermes_cli.slash_exec.EXECUTORS`, and
  * produce IDENTICAL core text across surfaces for a fixed context — the
    executor may only vary on ``args``/``options``, never on ``surface``.
