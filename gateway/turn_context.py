"""Per-turn context shared between ``GatewayRunner._run_agent_inner`` and the
``TurnRunner`` collaborator (gateway/run.py).

``_run_agent_inner`` historically defined its tool-progress plumbing as nested
closures (``progress_callback`` ~250 LOC, ``send_progress_messages`` ~353 LOC)
that closed over ~20 enclosing locals.  ``TurnContext`` is the extraction seam:
each closed-over local becomes a field on this dataclass, so the closure bodies
can move onto ``TurnRunner`` methods unchanged modulo ``name`` -> ``ctx.name``
rewrites.

Field notes:

- All fields are written once by ``_run_agent_inner`` while wiring up the turn
  (a few — ``_progress_metadata``, ``_progress_reply_to``, ``agent_holder`` —
  are computed slightly later than construction and assigned onto the ctx as
  soon as the original locals were bound).  None of the original closures
  *rebound* their captured names (no ``nonlocal``); mutable state uses the
  same single-element-list containers as before (``last_progress_msg``,
  ``repeat_count``, ...), so mutation stays visible to the outer body through
  the shared objects exactly as it did through the shared closure cells.
- ``_run_still_current`` stays a callable (it captures ``self``/
  ``session_key``/``run_generation``); carrying the callable keeps the
  extracted bodies byte-identical.
