"""Abstract base for proxy upstream adapters.

An :class:`UpstreamAdapter` represents one OAuth-authenticated provider the
local proxy can forward requests to. The adapter is responsible for:

  - locating the user's auth state for that provider
  - refreshing/minting credentials when needed
  - reporting the resolved upstream base URL
  - declaring which request paths it accepts

The proxy server is otherwise provider-agnostic.
